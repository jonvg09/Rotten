A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander  some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story ;1

Aggressive self  glorification and a manipulative whitewash ;1
A comedy  drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis ;4
Narratively  Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess ;1
The Importance of Being Earnest  so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett s Familiar Quotations;3
But it does nt leave you with much ;1
You could hate it for the same reason ;1
